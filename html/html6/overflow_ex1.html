		Just because you'll always be
		Miles ahead of me
		I don't see why I shouldn't try
		To catch up with you
		'Cause in my mind a thousand times or more
		I've been there before
		There's nothin' I can see
		That will stop me, believe me
		Our time will come
		An' I don't think I will let another chance
		Pass me by
